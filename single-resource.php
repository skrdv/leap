        Flex Fridays feature interactive projects and activities around content that may not fit into the planned curriculum but are based on topics of interest for students. Many Flex Friday activities are created, planned and taught by the students themselves.

            As far as Flex Friday goes, we want to give students the opportunity to do something that they may not see during their academic day throughout the week, that can be in a controlled environment… having the kids have an opportunity that’s not conventional and confined to our normal classroom… They show you what they’ve done in Flex Friday and the products are phenomenal. Kids are doing things that I never expected them to be doing this early… These kids are proud of their projects; they want to display them.”

        How Flex Fridays Work in Mr. McWade’s Class

          <div class="container">
          <div class="step-label">Step 1.</div>
          <div class="step-text">Consider individual student interests and the needs of the class community. Determine skills that will meet class needs and incorporate those skills into experiences focused on student interests. For example, if the class needs practice with collaboration or team skills, design activities focused on student interests that require teamwork to create and problem solve.</div>

        <div class="step">
          <div class="container">
          <div class="step-label">Step 2.</div>
          <div class="step-text">Provide opportunities for students to take ownership of creating content and learning experiences for their peers. Teachers then shift their roles to mentor and coach students as they develop their own lessons. Ask if there are students interested in teaching topics that interest them. Encourage reluctant learners to showcase their strengths and passions.</div>

        <div class="step">
          <div class="container">
          <div class="step-label">Step 3.</div>
          <div class="step-text">Many activities change each Friday, giving students a variety of experiences from which to choose. To keep up with the varied student interests, regularly ask students what they would like to learn. Also, pay attention to what students are reading and talking about with each other. Use this information to create interactive learning experiences based on those interests.</div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <div class="container">
          <div class="step-label">Step 4.</div>
          <div class="step-text">Partner with learners to continuously align learning opportunities with learners’ interests, strengths and needs. When many of his students expressed interest in learning a second language, Mr. McWade strategically encouraged and involved two students who were commonly reluctant to engage in class discussion. The opportunity to teach their peers revealed a more confident side of these students who thrived when sharing their strengths.</div>

          <div class="container">
          <div class="step-label">Step 5.</div>
          <div class="step-text">Partner with learners to reflect upon and document their own learning needs and progress. After Flex Friday, teachers provide an opportunity for students to reflect on their learning and share it with their peers. Consider a variety of ways that students can show what they’ve learned: Google Classroom posts, slide presentations, videos, graffiti boards, learning journals, portfolios and so much more!</div>
